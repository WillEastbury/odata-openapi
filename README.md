This work is a simple hosting container for the OASIS OData-openapi js executable.

It exists solely to demonstrate how to provide a simple HTML5 wrapper around the OASIS code repository, primarily for the purpose of making it easier to work with SAP odata services and their XML metadata when wanting to publish them through Azure API Management.
 
You can see it in action, and convert odata definitions to openapi specifications here <insert link here>.
